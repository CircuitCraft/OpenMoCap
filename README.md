# OpenMoCap
The great piece of well-known projects in this direction cost a lot of money or are unusable, because they are difficult to buiilt or tune. In our development, we do not pursue the goal of making money, we just want to make Motion Capture technology available for everyone. Therefore, this is an open source project. We are also glad to see anyone who wants to help in the development of the software or hardware part of the project. Our project oriented on DIY, and not contain deficit, rare or obsolete components.

**This repo contain follow projects:**
- MoCap Arm (work)
- MoCap Leg (planned)
- MoCap Body (planned)
- FaceRig Vision (in future)
